# Password-Manager
The first project that I've worked on. As said by the name, it is supposed to manage passwords that the user inputs. You can make a password, search for one, view all passwords, and delete passwords. Still new to python so suggestions and comments would be appreciated. I was told that I should also encrypt the passwords which I am currently working on learning.
